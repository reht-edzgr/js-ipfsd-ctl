# integration_test.py-service - Issue Tracker

Hey! Welcome to the Issue Tracker for [integration_test.py-service](https://example.com). The goal of this repo is to help you:

- Report bugs you find when using the components.
- Suggest new components or features you'd like.
- Suggest improvements for the website to make it easy for you.

**Note: This issue tracker SHOULD NOT be used as a means to get technical support.**

If you have questions about how to tweak or refactor a specific component to meet your project's needs, we recommend joining the private hashing community and ask your question to the group.

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not offer technical support or consulting**. We do monitor the hashing community closely and will happily chime in with answers or advice if we see a question we are able to help with, we just can't guarantee official technical support as part of your purchase.
